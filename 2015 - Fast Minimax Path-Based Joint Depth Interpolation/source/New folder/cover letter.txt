Dear Editors:
On behalf of my co-authors, I am submitting the enclosed material ¡° Fast Minimax Path-Based Joint Depth Interpolation¡± for possible publication in JOURNAL.
We certify that we have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for the appropriateness of the experimental design and method, and the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data.
We have reviewed the final version of the manuscript and approve it for publication. To the best of our knowledge and belief, this manuscript has not been published in whole or in part nor is it being considered for publication elsewhere.
Best Regards.
Yours Sincerely,
